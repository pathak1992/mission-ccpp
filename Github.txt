Step 1 -
		Make one Branch in Github
		git clone url
			or
		if you clone first and add branch later then just pull to update the repository locally	
		Go to that folder 
		by  
			cd Foldername
and then
		git pull origin
	

Step 2 -
	First check in which branch you are working
	git branch -a


	select specific branch use command
	git checkout branchname

	
	 Use 	
	git pull origin 
	
	to pull the updated Branch Data..

Step 3 -
	
	Add Some files in that folder or make necessary changes in in code

	then 
	To check the data which is not updated in repository use 
		git status  
	  
	then you have to add that file or folder so use
			git add . 
			. means everything

	to check whether the files are added or not use 
			git status

Step 4 -
		to commit changes use command	
			git commit -m “Necessary Comment”
		
	then use
		push command to load the data in Repository
		
		git push -u origin branchname


Step 5 -
		if branch is final and no changes are required in that branch then merge branch to main
		git checkout main 
		
		git branch -a
		

		then use

		git merge branchname                          - - - - - the branch to be merge in main 

		git push -u origin main

step 6 -
	 To delete branch 
			git branch -d branchname		//deleted from locally repository referance
			
			git push -u origin  —delete branchname		//delete from repository
			
		To Confirm the branch is deleted or not
			git branch -a
